# SQL DataAnalysis Case

## Objective
Simulate the scenario of being hired as an _**eCommerce Data Analyst**_ for an online retailer which has just launched their first product. 
Following the growing path of the company, analyze and optimize marketing channels, measure and test website conversion performance, and use data to understand the impact of new product launches.

## Database
The database used in this project was provided by John Pauler of Maven Analytics. 

## Sections
Each section corresponds to a set of concepts and analysis applied to understanding the development of the Maven Fuzzy Factory over time. Therefore, the queries will be restricted by dates in order to simulate real time analysis in a growing business. In each section, find SQL scripts and a line of comment  summaryzing the concepts and the next step move.
