-- General Task: tell the stakeholder the story of company's growth, using trended performance data. Analyze current performance and use the data available to assess upcoming opportunities. 

-- Task 1: tell the story of our website performance improvements over the course of the first 8 months. Could you pull session to order conversion rates, by month?

-- Task 2: For the gsearch lander test, please estimate the revenue that test earned us (Hint: Look at the increase in CVR from the test (Jun 19 – Jul 28), and use nonbrand sessions and revenue since then to calculate incremental value)

-- Task 3: For the landing page test you analyzed previously, it would be great to show a full conversion funnel from each of the two pages to orders. You can use the same time period you analyzed last time (Jun 19 – Jul 28).

-- Task 4: I’d love for you to quantify the impact of our billing test, as well. 
-- Please analyze the lift generated from the test (Sep 10 – Nov 10), in terms of revenue per billing page session, and then pull the number of billing page sessions for the past month to understand monthly impact.
