-- Task: build up a full conversion funnel between the new /lander-1 page and placing an order, to understand where the 'gsearch' visitors lost.
-- Clarify: Start with/lander -1 and build the funnel all the way to our thank you page . Please use data since August 5 5th 2012.

-- Next Step: start from billing page, the product team will make the customer more comfortable in entering the credit card info, analyze the billing page test the plans to run.
